#Basic Utils for use with a macOS running Apple Silicon chip.

_Will Update for more OS's, chip architectures, etc. in the future_

1. Clone the repository
2. cd into the directory

```bash
cd Utils
touch .env.github .env.github.currentUser
```

Complete the TODO list. I recommend using the "TODO Tree" extension to view them, or search for 'TODO'.

To set up the files to be executable, check for and install all needed dependencies, run:

```bash
sudo chmod +x ./setup.sh
```

```bash
./setup.sh
```
